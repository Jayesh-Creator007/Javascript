1.

var is like ppl

it can use the same name many times

it is like Indian ppl, no boundary can stop it like {}

 a global variable can be created by var

let and const are having very less security comepare to var

2.

let can be use again and again with the same name or variable but it have to be print in the line before the other time it is used 


let num1=100

console.log(num1)


num2= 200

to print 100 console should be used before 200 one

it can be used in {} so the main num will get 100 only

Eg.

let num=1

{
let num=2

}

2 can be used in {} only 

but 1 can be use in the {} if it is defined out of it



3.


both let and var have equal power no one will over write each other


4.


const is pog ppl


never talk in two different sentence and never change the the words back 
it can only talk in a singl sentence


5.

parceInt/parcefloat use to convert string in to integers


6.


typeof can be used to know what type of data is used or

what type of  data is input
